# Question 5: Rectangles

## Explaination

### Task 1

I literally draw the box on a whiteboard and solve manually.

### Task 2

I realise that its just one blue box so I calculate manually in spreadsheet **the longest height** x **sum of all width**

### Task 4

I realise that there are more blue box than red box so the answer is just the sum of area of all red box. I calculate manually with spreadsheet.

### Task 3

Well guess I can't really solve all question without programming huh. For this question, I wrote a code specifically tailored towards this task: `t3.cpp`, which will only works if there is two blue rectangles.

This code iterates through each red rectangles, for each red rectangles calculate the total area if blue rectangles 1 cover from the first red rectangle up to this red rectangle, and blue rectangle 2 cover the remaining rectangles.

### Task 5

This task took me forever (I spent hours on this). The code is in `q5.py`. I manage to find a similar type of problem online: maximum rectangular area in a histogram. After studying the problem I found, I manage to write the code for this problem with dynamic programming (which I just learnt, thanks MCC).
