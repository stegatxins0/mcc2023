# Question 6: Sum^k

## Explaination

### First Few Tasks

Generate all the possible subset, find the sum of all of them to the power of k, and add all of them. This is implemented in `q6.cpp`.


### Next Few Tasks (Unsolved)

Man, I thought it's gonna be easy. I was so wrong. I come to realise that the time complexity of the original approach is too high and it won't work on code with larger n. 

I spent the entirety of second day attempting this question, but I have no idea if I am approaching it from the right way. I took a look at CodeForces #932E Team Work, and I still can't figure out. Took a look at many different concepts and unfortunately I didn't manage to solve it, although I highly suspect it requires playing around with binomial expansion.
